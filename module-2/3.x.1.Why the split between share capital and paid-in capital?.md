# Legal purposes
- par value is often the minimum value per share that shareholders must pay
- the share capital becomes the legal capital of the company
- legally protected and not available for dividend payouts
- helps protect creditors
	- company can't return this to the shareholders during liquidation
# Transparency and disclosure
- helps analysts, investors and regulators
- how much was raised from issuing stock
- how much was paid over par
	- often reflects market confidence
# Accounting consistency
- common stock shows the minimum claim on the company
- paid-in capital shows the excess contributed by investors
# Dividend restrictions
In some jurisdictions, companies can only pay dividends **out of retained earnings** or **paid-in capital**, but not from the **legal capital** (common stock). Splitting the values ensures compliance with such laws.
