- balance sheet : assets, liabilities and equities at a given time
- income statements : revenues and expenses over a period of time
The cash flow statement fills the gap between the balance sheet and income statement by showing how much cash is generated or spent, operating investing and financing activities over a specific period.
# Financier vs. Accountant
## Financier
- cares more about the cash inflows and outflows
- cash flows determine the value of a business
## Accountant
- cares more about accounting the income
- **cash flow is different from earnings**
	- non-cash items like depreciation and amortization
Say the company buys a piece of equipment with a life of 3 years for $3000.

| Year | Cash outflow | Depreciation expense |
| ---- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| 1    | $3000        | $1000                |
| 2    | 0            | $1000                |
| 3    | 0            | $1000                |
# Why cash flow?
- depreciation can be calculated in multiple ways
	- has an impact on the taxes and net income
	- too much leeway
- other items on the balance sheet and income statement face the same problem
- cash flow is more accurate
	- numbers are harder to manipulate
# Cash flow statement
## Operating activities
| **Operating activities**                                 |       |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Net income                                               | $3281 |
| **Adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided** |       |
| Depreciation and amortization                            | $2604 |
| Share-based compensation expense                         | $147  |
| Deferred income taxes                                    | $178  |
| Change in inventory                                      | $505  |
| Change in other assets                                   | $18   |
| Change in accounts payable                               | $140  |
| Change in accrued and other liabilities                  | $199  |
| Other adjustments                                        | $45   |
| Cash provided by operating activities                    | $7117 |
The indirect method starts with the *net income* (from the income statement) and makes adjustments to reconcile it with actual cash generated from operations.
- **net income**
- **depreciation and amortization**
	- depreciation expense isn't a cash outflow
- **share based compensation**
	- eg: stock options to employees
- **deferred income taxes**
	- taxes recorded in the income statement but not yet paid in cash
	- timing differences are reconciled
- **change in inventory**
	- increase -> uses cash
	- decrease -> frees up cash
- **change in other assets**
- **change in accounts payable**
	- increase => company hasn't paid cash yet -> boosts cash flow
- **change in accrued and other liabilities**
- **other adjustments**
	- more non-cash or timing differences
## Investment activities
| **Investing activities**                         |         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Expenditure for property and equipment           | ($3027) |
| Proceeds from disposal of property and equipment | $63     |
| Other investments                                | $20     |
| Cash required for investing activities           | ($2944) |
*(parentheses indicate outflow)*
- **Expenditure for property and equipment**
	- doesn't show up on the income statement
	- spread over the life of the equipment
## Financing activities
| **Financing activities**               |         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Addition to long-term debt             | $1739   |
| Reductions of long-term debt           | ($2069) |
| Dividends paid                         | ($1330) |
| Repurchase of stock                    | ($1565) |
| Stock option exercises                 | $73     |
| Cash required for financing activities | ($3152) |
## Net change
| **Net change**                                   |       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Net change in cash and cash equivalents          | $1021 |
| Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period | $1556 |
| Cash and cash equivalents at end of period       | $2577 |
- cash and cash equivalents numbers match the balance sheet
