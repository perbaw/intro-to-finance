# Liquidity
The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without significant reduction in its value.
## Liquid assets
- needed to meet near-term obligations
	- pay creditors, utilities, etc.
- also important in emergencies 
## Fixed assets
- fixed assets are less liquid
	- real estate, equipment etc.
	- highly specific assets
	- low resale value
- accounts receivable are more liquid than inventory
- company can sell its accounts receivable to a **factoring company**
	- if the company needs immediate cash
	- 75% of the receivables value is paid immediately
	- the remaining (minus factoring fees) is rebated one the payments have been collected 
## Striking a balance
- too much liquidity is bad
	- rate of return is lower than that from fixed assets
- a business is valuable only because it produces goods and services with the investment in fixed assets 
- balancing liquid and fixed assets is important
### Personal finances
- liquid savings are needed to pay bills and handle emergencies
- have 3-6 months of monthly expenses liquid
- sitting on too much cash is bad
	- banks pay almost nothing
	- return on cash can't keep up with inflation
	- your purchasing power is reduced
- invest in fixed assets as well
# Net working capital
**NWC = Current assets - Current liabilities**
- evaluates if a company's short term assets are available to pay short-term obligations
- good indicator of a firm's liquidity in the short term
	- NWC > 0 => company has enough short-term liquidity ot pay its current obligations
	- NWC < 0 => company needs to borrow/raise money to remain solvent
# Book value and market value
## Book value of assets
- assets shown on the balance sheet
- assets at original cost, adjusted for depreciation and amortization
## Market value of assets
- current asset price in the marketplace
## Book value of equity
- difference between the total assets and total liabilities (balance sheet identity)
- just ensures the balance of the balance sheet
## Market value of equity
- value of a company based on the financial markets
- current share price x total number of outstanding shares
- aka **market capitalization**
- market cap > book value => investors trust the company's earning capabilities
