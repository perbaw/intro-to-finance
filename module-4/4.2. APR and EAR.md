# Annual percentage rate (APR)
The rate that a bank is required to quote on loans it extends. 
It is the **simple interest rate that doesn't consider compounding**.
$\boxed{\text{APR}=\text{periodic interest rate} \times \text{number of compounding periods in a year}}$
## End of year value
$\boxed{\text{FV}=\text{PV}(1+\frac{r}{m})^{mT}}$
- $m$ = number of times compounded per year
- $T$ = number of years
- $r$ = interest rate
Both APR and compounding frequency need to be considered while choosing from loan options.
# Effective annual rate (EAR)
- true annual rate
- accounts for compounding
$\boxed{\text{EAR}=(1+\frac{r}{m})^{m}-1}$
# Continuous compounding
- compounding frequency $\to \infty$ 
$\boxed{\text{FV}=\text{PV}\times e^{rT}}$
