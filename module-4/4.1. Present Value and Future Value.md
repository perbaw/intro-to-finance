# Time value of money
- a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow
- earning potential of money

$\boxed{\text{FV}=\text{PV}(1+r)^T}$
- $FV$ = future value
- $PV$ = present value
- $r$ = interest rate
- $T$ = number of periods over which cash is invested

$\boxed{\text{PV}=\frac{\text{FV}}{(1+r)^T}}$
- $FV$ = future value
- $PV$ = present value
- $r$ = discount rate
- $T$ = number of periods over which cash is invested

# Net present value
## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

$\boxed{PV=\sum_{t=1}^{T}{\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}}}$
- $C_t$ = Cash flow in period $t$

$\boxed{NPV=C_0+\sum_{t=1}^{T}{\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}}}$
- $C_0$ = initial cash flow (usually negative, coz investment)

- $\text{NPV}>0$ => take the project
- $\text{NPV}\leq0$ => reject the project
# Discount rate
- aka rate of return
- aka hurdle rate
- aka opportunity cost of capital
	- return of a forgone investment option with the same level of risk
- risky project -> higher discount rate
	- researching a new product
	- expanding into a new market
# Internal rate of return
- discount rate that sets NPV to 0
- accept the project if IRR > required rate of return
- if deciding between multiple projects, pick the one with the highest IRR
