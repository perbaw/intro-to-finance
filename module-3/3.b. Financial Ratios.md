# Ways of comparison
## Time-trend analysis
- change in company's performance over time
- see if company is improving
## Peer group analysis
- compare financial ratios with major competitors and industry average
# Financial ratios
- Short-term liquidity ratios
- Long-term solvency ratios
- Asset turnover ratios
- Profitability ratios
- Market value ratios
# Liquidity ratios
Liquidity ratios give a pretty solid view of a company's ability to pay its short-term bills. These are commonly looked at by lenders in the approval process. 
## Current ratio

$\boxed{\text{Current ratio} = \frac{\text{Current assets}}{\text{Current liabilities}}}$

- company's ability to pay its short-term liabilities
- different current assets have different liquidities
	- cash and cash equivalents -> high
	- accounts receivable -> medium
	- inventory -> low
	- current ratio doesn't account for this
## Quick ratio

$\boxed{\text{Quick ratio} = \frac{\text{Cash}+\text{Marketable securities}+\text{Accounts receivable}}{\text{Current liabilities}}}$

- aka Acid test ratio
- numerator is current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses
## Cash ratio

$\boxed{\text{Cash ratio}=\frac{\text{Cash and cash equivalents}}{\text{Current liabilities}}}$

- most conservative liquidity ratio
- mostly used to evaluate a company in financial distress
	- hard to liquefy accounts receivable and inventory
- trade-off of holding a lot of cash
	- creditors can get paid
	- but cash brings low returns
## Operating cash flow ratio

$\boxed{\text{Operating cash ratio}=\frac{\text{Cash flow from operations}}{\text{Current liabilities}}}$

- capacity of a company's cash generated from operating activities to pay its current liabilities
# Solvency ratios (Leverage ratios)
Leverage ratios need to be within an appropriate range that varies by industry and company
## Total debt ratio

$\boxed{\text{Total debt ratio}=\frac{\text{Total assets}-\text{Total stockholders' equity}}{\text{Total assets}}=\frac{\text{Total liabilities}}{\text{Total assets}}}$

- important to note the definition of debt being used in the ratio
	- broad version of debt that includes all current and long-term liabilities
	- narrow version doesn't include accounts payable, accrued expenses, etc.
## Equity multiplier

$\boxed{\text{Equity multiplier}=\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total stockholders' equity}}}$

- indicates how much equity financing the company uses
- tells us about the capital structure of the company
### Costs and benefits of debt
#### Benefits
- tax shield
	- interests are tax deductible
	- dividends aren't tax deductible and come from after-tax income
	- $\therefore$ debt financing is usually cheaper than equity financing
- debt benefits existing shareholders because of financial leverage
##### Financial leverage
Leveraging is the practice of using borrowed money to potentially amplify returns to equity shareholders
Let’s say a company has ₹100 in equity and earns ₹10 profit (10% return).  
Now imagine it borrows ₹100 (at 5% interest) and still earns ₹20 on the total ₹200.
- Interest = ₹5
- Profit after interest = ₹15
- Return to shareholders = ₹15 on ₹100 = **15% return** (up from 10%)
#### Costs
- debts are obligations
- creditors can sue company if its payments default
	- can lead to bankruptcy
- if the company uses too much debt, the business becomes risky for investors and creditors
## Interest coverage ratio

$\boxed{\text{Interest coverage ratio}=\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest expense}}}$

- this is the most commonly used of several versions
- aka times interest earned
- how easily the company can pay its interest expenses with its earnings
- used by creditors to assess the risk of a company's debt
- commonly accepted that interest coverage ratio should be at least 1.5
# Turnover ratios
These ratios tell us if a company uses its assets efficiently
## Inventory turnover

$\boxed{\text{Inventory turnover}=\frac{\text{Cost of goods sold}}{\text{Inventory}}}$

- cost of goods comes from the income statement (FY)
- inventory comes from the balance sheet at some point in time
- which inventory to consider?
	- beginning inventory
	- end inventory
	- average inventory
- follow the industry standard

- retailers prefer high inventory turnover
	- high holding costs
	- storage, insurance, etc.
- low inventory turnover =>
	- weak sales
	- company is holding too much inventory
## Days' sales in inventory (DSI)

$\boxed{\text{DSI}=\frac{\text{365 days}}{\text{Inventory turnover}}}$

- average time the company takes to convert inventory into sales 
## Total asset turnover

$\boxed{\text{Total asset turnover}=\frac{\text{Total revenues}}{\text{Total assets}}}$

- tells us how efficient the company is at generating revenue from its assets
# Profitability ratios
Profitability ratios are a key consideration for investors.
## Gross profit margin

$\boxed{\text{Gross profit margin}=\frac{\text{Gross profit}}{\text{Total revenues}}=\frac{\text{Total revenues}-\text{Cost of goods sold}}{\text{Total revenues}}}$
## Net profit margin

$\boxed{\text{Net profit margin}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total revenue}}}$

If a company's profit margin is in line with the industry or is rising compared to its peers, we know the company is good at generating profits from its sales and controlling its costs.
## Return on assets (ROA)

$\boxed{\text{ROA}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total assets}}}$
## Return on equity (ROE)

$\boxed{\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total equity}}}$

- measures how well management is attaining the goal of shareholder wealth maximization

$\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total equity}}\times\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total assets}}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total assets}}\times\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total equity}}$

$\boxed{\text{ROE}={\text{ROA}}\times{\text{Equity multiplier}}}$

- ROE is different from ROA due to financial leverage
- if the company uses a lot of debt, ROE will be higher than ROA
- otherwise, the two values will be close to each other
## DuPont identity

$\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total assets}}\times\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total equity}}\times\frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Total revenue}}=\frac{\text{Net income}}{\text{Total revenue}}\times\frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Total assets}}\times\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{Total equity}}$

$\boxed{\text{ROE}=\text{Net profit margin}\times\text{Total asset turnover}\times\text{Equity multiplier}}$

- first adopted by the DuPont corporation to evaluate the performance of its corporate divisions
- three factors affect ROE
	1. **Net profit margin**: measure of operating efficiency
	2. **Total asset turnover**: measure of asset use efficiency
	3. **Equity multiplier**: measure of financial leverage
## How to improve net profit margin?
1. increase prices
	- requires pricing power and customer loyalty
2. reduce costs
	- without compromising too much on quality
	- improve productivity through automation
	- review fixed costs (advertising, training, etc.)
# Market value ratios
These ratios are important to investors.
## Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio

$\boxed{\text{P/E ratio}=\frac{\text{Current share price}}{\text{Earnings per share}}}$

- measure of how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar in current earnings
- use with caution
	- ratio can't be used when the company's earnings are negative
	- sometimes P/E ratio is high because of near-zero earnings, not high share price
## Market capitalization

$\boxed{\text{Market cap}=\text{Current share price}\times\text{Total number of outstanding shares}}$
### Large-cap firm
Market cap > $10B
- often large, reputed firms within an industry
- steady growth
- constant dividend payments
### Mid-cap firm
$10B > Market cap > $2B
- companies that're still growing and expanding
- moderate risks and returns
### Small-cap firm
$2B > Market cap > $300M
- young companies or companies in emerging industries
- very vulnerable to business cycles, especially economic downturn
- highest returns because of the growth potential
