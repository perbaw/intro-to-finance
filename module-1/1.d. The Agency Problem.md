# Agency problem
- agency relationship exists whenever a principal hires an agent to represent his/her interests
- conflict of interest can arise between the firm's owners and managers
	- managers are more concerned about their job security than shareholder value
- this is prevalent in corporate settings as owners and managers are separated
# Agency costs
## Direct costs
- expenditures that benefit company's management but cost the shareholders
- monitoring costs: cost of monitoring the managers
- eg:  corporate jets, other luxuries
## Indirect costs
- costs incurred due to lost opportunities
- difficult to enumerate this cost
- eg: high risk, high reward projects may be rejected by managers due to the fear of failure costing them their jobs 
# Solutions to the agency problem
## Managerial compensation
- aligns objectives of managers and shareholders
- ~60% of CEO pay comes from stock-option awards tied to performance targets
	- the stock-options encourage management to maximize share value in order to increase their profits 
## Replace management
- poor performance of management makes the company a target for other companies
- mergers and acquisitions
# Enron
- company started losing money and accumulating debt
	- management tried to hide it from investors and creditors
	- off balance sheets, special purpose vehicles
- scandal unfolded in 2001
	- SEC investigation
	- share price dropped from over $90 to $0
	- senior managers charged with insider trading and securities fraud
	- company went bankrupt
- management failed to carry out their responsibility of protecting shareholder interests
- Enron's auditor firm, Arthur Anderson, also provided it consulting services
	- hefty consulting fees
	- didn't perform its auditing duties properly so as to not lose a customer
## Sarbanes-Oxley Act
- accuracy of financial reporting
- based on Enron's lesson
- public companires accounting oversight board
- independence of auditors
	- auditing companies are prohibited from providing non-audit services
- mandates that top execs take personal responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of corporate financial reports
