# Why is maximizing profit not the goal?
- profit is an accounting term -> can be manipulated
- which year's profit do you consider?
  next year's profit -> managers can delay maintenance and training -> short-term profit, long-term harm
- share price, on the other hand, is easy to evaluate at any given time
# Current share price
- public company -> maximize current share value of existing stock
- no publicly traded stock -> maximize shareholder wealth
- is there a conflict between the goal of maximizing current stock value and other goals like employee safety, customer satisfaction, etc.?
	- generally, no
	- stock market is largely efficient
	- information is reflected in the market in the long run
# Stakeholders
- all parties related to the business: employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, investors, society
- employees
	- offer benefits
	- improve work environment
	- invest in training
	- help achieve professional goals
- customers
	- high quality products and services
	- sustained innovation
	- customer satisfaction
- US and UK: shareholder interest is the first priority
  Japan, Germany, France, etc.: stakeholder interests are more important
  eg: half the board of directors is chosen by the workers in Germany
- social, ethical and environmental responsibilities
